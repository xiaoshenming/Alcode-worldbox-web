## Code Idioms and Conventions

### Universal Principle

**Write idiomatic code for the target language:**

- Code should look natural to developers familiar with that language  
- Follow established community conventions, not personal preferences  
- Use language built-ins and standard library effectively  
- Apply language-appropriate patterns (don't force patterns from other languages)

### Idiomatic Code Characteristics

- Leverages language features (don't avoid features unnecessarily)  
- Follows language naming conventions  
- Uses appropriate error handling for language (exceptions vs Result types)  
- Applies established community patterns

### Avoid Cross-Language Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Don't write "Java in Python" or "C in Go"  
- ❌ Don't force OOP patterns in functional languages  
- ❌ Don't avoid language features because they're "unfamiliar"  
- ✅ Learn and apply language-specific idioms
