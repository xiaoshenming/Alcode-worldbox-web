## Logging and Observability Mandate

### Universal Requirement: All Operations Must Be Logged

**Every operation entry point MUST include logging. No exceptions.**

**What constitutes an "operation" (mandatory logging):**
- API endpoints and request handlers
- Background jobs and queue workers
- Event handlers and message consumers
- Scheduled tasks and cron jobs
- CLI commands
- External service calls (to third-party APIs)
- Database transactions

**What is NOT an operation (no direct logging):**
- Pure business logic functions (called within operations)
- Utility and helper functions
- Data transformations and validators

**Minimum logging requirement (3 points):**
1. **Operation start:** Log at entry with context (correlationId, userId, operation name)
2. **Operation success:** Log completion with duration and result identifiers
3. **Operation failure:** Log error with full context (correlationId, error details, stack trace)

**Mandatory context in all logs:**
- `correlationId`: UUID for tracing across services
- `operation`: Clear operation name (e.g., "create_order", "process_payment")
- `duration`: Execution time in milliseconds
- `userId`: Actor who triggered the operation (when applicable)
- `error`: Full error context on failures

**Enforcement strategy:**
Prefer middleware, decorators, or framework interceptors for automatic operation logging rather than manual logging in every handler. This ensures coverage without code duplication.

**When implementing any operation entry point, you MUST add logging before proceeding with implementation.**
